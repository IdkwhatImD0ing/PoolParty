## 💡Inspiration

Inspiration mostly came from the difficulies of organizing tranportation for a group people. We wanted to make it easier for people to organize and coordinate carpooling.

## 💻What it does

Pool Party lets users create a pool of people who are going to the same place at the same time. Users can then add themselves to the pool as either drivers or passengers. Drivers can then see the list of passengers and choose who they want to pick up. Passengers can see the list of drivers and choose who they want to ride with.
